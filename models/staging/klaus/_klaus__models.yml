          ### AutoQA Categories
          There are six categories that will get an automatic scoring in Klaus:

          - **Greeting**: fixed binary scale üëç üëé
          - **Grammar**: fixed 5-point scale
          - **Empathy**: fixed binary scale üëç üëé
          - **Closing**: binary scale üëç üëé
          - **Tone**: fixed 5-point scale
          - **Solution**: binary scale üëç üëé
          - **Readability**: fixed 3-point scale

          #### How do the AutoQA categories work?
          - **Greeting**: Answers the question ‚ÄúDid the agent greet the customer?‚Äù
          - **Closing**: Assesses the conversation answering question: "Did the agent close the conversation, take into consideration that offering further help and thanking the customer is a good closing message?"
          - **Empathy**: Assesses the conversation answering question ‚ÄúWas the Agent empathetic towards the customer and their problems?"
          - **Tone**: Recognizes the following 27 tones and calculates a score in 5 point scale based on that. Each tone has different weight, e.g. joyful 2.9 and frustrated -3. A conversation can have multiple different tones, each found tone has different positive or negative weights that are aggregated together. Tones include: accusatory, worried, curious, surprised, formal, confident, appreciative, concerned, sad, informal, regretful, encouraging, egocentric, joyful, optimistic, excited, polite, professional, frustrated, angry, disgusted, fun, friendly, supportive, polite, professional, apologetic.
          - **Solution**: Identifies whether or not a solution was proposed in the conversation. üëç if the agent offer a solution to the customer. If not then üëé And if not sure "N/A".
          - **Spelling & Grammar**: Detects all kinds of grammar mistakes which are grouped into 3 groups: grammar mistakes, misspelling mistakes and style mistakes.
          - **Readability**: Analyzes and evaluates how easily a text can be understood, considering word complexity and sentence length.
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 42]  # Assuming 0-4 are valid ratings and 42 or NULL is 'N/A'
              quote: false
